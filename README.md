# BiROCKET
Hello! The "BiROCKET" application is designed for designing solid-fuel rockets, determining their aerodynamic characteristics, and simulating flight in the Earth's atmosphere ðŸš€. The software has been implemented using the C++ programming language and the Qt graphics libraries. The mathematical model employed allows for the calculation of selected flight parameters along the trajectory plane, taking into account the inertial properties of the rocket projectile.

The program allows for the design of the rocket's warhead, fuselage, engine, bottom part, and fins while calculating their aerodynamic characteristics based on the methods of L. S. Czernobrowkin and A. A. Lebiediew. The Earth's atmosphere model used in the software is based on the AS-64 standard.

To run the application, you need to download the files from the repository and open the BiROCKETRT.exe file.
